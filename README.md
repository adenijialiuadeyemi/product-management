Product Management System - Backend API
This project is part of my Internpulse internship, where I was tasked with building a backend API for a Product Management System. The API allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete products. It follows RESTful principles and is implemented using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

Features
Create a Product: Add a new product by providing its name.
Retrieve Products: Fetch product details by querying by name or ID.
Update a Product: Update product information either by name or ID.
Delete a Product: Remove a product from the system using its name or ID.
Error Handling: Appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages are returned for various error scenarios (e.g., 404 Not Found, 400 Bad Request).
Unit Testing: The API is tested using Jest and Supertest for each endpoint.
Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend runtime environment.
Express.js: Framework for building the API.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing product data.
Mongoose: MongoDB Object Data Modeling (ODM) for better interaction with the database.
dotenv: For managing environment variables.
Jest: JavaScript testing framework for unit tests.
Supertest: HTTP assertions for API testing.

Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js: Install Node.js on your machine.
MongoDB: You can use MongoDB Atlas or install MongoDB locally.

Steps
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-management.git
cd product-management
2. Install dependencies:
npm install
3. Setup environment variables:
Create a config.js file in the root directory and add the following:
export const PORT = 5555;
export const mongoDbURL = your_mongodb_connection_string
4. Start the server:
npm run dev

The API will be running at http://localhost:5555.

API Endpoints
Create Product: 
    URL: /products
    Method: POST
    Request Body:
        {
            "productName": "Product Name"
        }
    Response:
        {
            "product": { ... }
        }


Get Product by Name or ID
    URL: /api/products?name=ProductName (by name) or /api/products/:id (by ID)
    Method: GET
    Response:
        {
            "_id": "productId",
            "name": "Product Name",
            "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
            "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
        }


Update Product by Name or ID
    URL: /api/products?name=OldProductName (by name) or /api/products/:id (by ID)
    Method: PUT
    Request Body:
        {
            "name": "New Product Name"
        }
    Response:
        {
            "message": "Product updated successfully",
            "product": { ... }
        }


Delete Product by Name or ID:
    URL: /product?name=productName (by name) or /product/:id (by ID)
    Method: DELETE

Response:
{
  "message": "Product deleted successfully!!!"
}


Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:
npm test


Error Handling
The API uses proper error handling for various scenarios:

400 Bad Request: If required fields are missing or invalid.
404 Not Found: If a product is not found.
500 Internal Server Error: For unexpected server errors.

Deployment
You can deploy the API to any platform supporting Node.js, such as:
Heroku
Vercel
DigitalOcean
To deploy:

Push the project to a GitHub repository.
Follow the platformâ€™s steps for deployment.
Make sure to set environment variables like MONGO_URI on the hosting platform.
